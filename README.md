# Summary
Termineter is a Python framework which provides a platform for the security
testing of smart meters.  It implements the C1218 and C1219 protocols for
communication over an optical interface.  Currently supported are Meters using
C1219-2007 with 7-bit character sets.  This is the most common configuration
found in North America.  Termineter communicates with Smart Meters via a
connection using an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a serial interface.
